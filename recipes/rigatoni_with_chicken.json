Add the shallot to the chicken pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallot has softened, 3-4 mins. Stir in the veg stock paste and reserved pasta water, then simmer until reduced by half, 3-4 mins. Mix in the creme fraiche and heat through until piping hot, then season with pepper. Stir through three quarters of the grated hard Italian style cheese. IMPORTANT: The chicken is cooked when no longer pink in the middle.",
