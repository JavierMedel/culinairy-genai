Pat pork dry with paper towels, then cut in half crosswise. Season with salt and half the Montreal Steak Spice (use all for 4 ppl). Coat pork all over with Dijon-garlic mixture. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then pork. Sear, turning occasionally, until golden-brown, 4-5 min. Transfer pork to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast in the middle of the oven until cooked through, 14-16 min. When pork is done, transfer to a clean cutting board to rest, 3-5 min. Reserve any drippings to add to gravy. Carefully wipe the pan clean.",

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-high. Cook uncovered until fork-tender, 10-12 min. Drain and return veggies to the same pot, off heat. Season with salt and pepper. Mash 2 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl) into veggies until almost creamy. (NOTE: Cauliflower-potato mash will still have a few lumps!)",
